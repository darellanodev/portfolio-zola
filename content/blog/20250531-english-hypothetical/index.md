In my course of improving my English, I study unreal or hypothetical phrases and how to use the "were" instead of the "was".

![english-hypothetical](./english-hypothetical.png)

Here are some hypothetical or unreal phrases where you must use the "were" instead of the "was":

- I'd go shopping with you if I weren't so busy
  (This is not true, I am not busy right now)

- If I were rich, I would travel the world
  (In reality, I am not rich)

- If I were you, I would study more
  (I am not you, but I imagine what I would do if I were you)

- If she weren't afraid of dogs, she would have a pet
  (In reality, she is afraid of dogs)

- If we had more time, we could visit Paris
  (In reality, we don't have time, but we imagine this possibility)
