- insert new line after / before: `o / O`
- yanking a linke: `yy`
- pasting: `p`
- searching: `/`
- changing a word: `ciw`
- changing inside doble quotes: `ci"`
- changing inside tag: `cit`
- repeat last action: `.`
- replace mode: `R`
- appending at the final of the line: `A`
- Inserting at the beginning of the line: `I`
