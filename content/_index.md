My name is Daniel Arellano and I am a developer and graphic designer. Here you can see some of my personal projects. Currently I am working on a game called [Gif Tower Defense](https://github.com/darellanodev/gif-tower-defense) and other game called [Mini Jetpack](https://github.com/darellanodev/jetpack-game). Professionally, I have more than 15 years of experience in the e-learning industry.
